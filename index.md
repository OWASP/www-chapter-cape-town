## Welcome
OWASP Cape Town is a local South African chapter aimed at reaching and engaging the local developer and infosec community. 
OWASP Cape Town holds regular meetups as well as gets involved in local conferences and groups, such as, [BSIDES Cape Town](https://bsidescapetown.co.za). 

OWASP Cape Town is community driven and we always welcome local people to get involved in giving talks and share how they are doing their bit in securing the web. Please reach out if you would like to give a talk.

### Public particpation on the South African 'Cybercrimes and Cybersecurity Bill (B6â€“2017)' 
During the public participation phase of the South African law-making process, OWASP Cape Town collected and provided many comments on the original 'Cybercrimes and Cybersecurity Bill (B6-2017)'. After a lengthy process the cybersecurity provisions, relating to intelligence services, were removed and the bill was renamed the Cybercrimes Bill.
